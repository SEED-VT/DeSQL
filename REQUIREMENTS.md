To effectively engage with DeSQL's artifacts, users should have a fundamental understanding of Docker, as it is the primary platform for setting up the DeSQL environment. Familiarity with basic SQL concepts, the Apache Spark framework, and Python3 is also recommended. The DeSQL setup is designed to run locally, alleviating the need for a complex cluster node configuration, making it more accessible for a wider audience. Further details about the simulation environment for replicating the results reported in the research paper can be found in Section 5 of the DeSQL research paper.
